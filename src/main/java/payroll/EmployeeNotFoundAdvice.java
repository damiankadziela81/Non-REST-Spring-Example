/*
When an EmployeeNotFoundException is thrown, this extra tidbit of Spring MVC configuration is used to render an HTTP 404:

@ResponseBody signals that this advice is rendered straight into the response body.

@ExceptionHandler configures the advice to only respond if an EmployeeNotFoundException is thrown.

@ResponseStatus says to issue an HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, i.e. an HTTP 404.

The body of the advice generates the content. In this case, it gives the message of the exception.
